# Image Processing Course

This repository contains assignments and projects for the Image Processing course. The course covers various topics related to manipulating and analyzing digital images.

## Assignments

### HW1 - Reading and Basic Image Operations

In this assignment, we learned how to read .bmp bitmap image files, modify the header file, and perform simple image operations such as merging different images and inverting grayscale.

### HW2 - Image Enhancement Techniques

For this assignment, we explored image enhancement techniques including histogram equalization, logarithmic transformation, and power-law transformation to adjust the global pixel values of images.

### HW3 - Template Matching with Multi-threading

In HW3, we implemented template matching techniques and used multi-threading and the pyramid method to accelerate the matching process.

### Midterm - Solar Panel Counting

The midterm project involved analyzing a grayscale image of a solar panel and using convolution and filters to determine the total number of solar panels present.
